# Snapp CLI

WIP. Not ready for use. File & project templates need to be added when SnarkyJS is ready.

## Installation (during development)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jasongitmail/snapp-cli.git
npm i
cd snapp-cli
npm link
```

This will make the command available globally on your system.

## Usage

```sh
snapp --help
```

Both `snapp` and `snap` work. Aliases are provided for both.
